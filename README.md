# Login-Axios
Reactnative APP
This is a simple React Native project that demonstrates how to implement a login screen and retrieve data from an API using Axios. The project is intended to be used as a starting point for more complex projects that require user authentication and data retrieval.

Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

bash

git clone https://github.com/JinD3vi1/Login-Axios/
cd <Login-Axios>

Next, install the dependencies:

npm install

Running the App

To run the app, use the following command:

npx expo -c

This will start the Metro server and open the Expo Developer Tools in your default web browser. From there, you can choose to run the app on an iOS or Android emulator, or on a physical device using the Expo app.

Note that you may need to install the Expo app on your physical device before you can run the app. You can download the Expo app from the App Store or Google Play.

Usage

Once you have the app running, you will be presented with a login screen. Enter the username "user" and the password "123" to log in. If the credentials are correct, you will be taken to a screen that displays data retrieved from an API using Axios.

The app uses a mock API that returns a list of users. To modify the API endpoint, edit the API_ENDPOINT variable in src/constants/index.js.
